# Reverse Engineering 101

Introductory Software Reverse Engineering Tutorial for Beginners

Disassembler: IDA

Assembly syntax: Intel

If you use AT&T syntax, I'd like to invite you to leave this repository. I have standards. <sub><sub>Just kidding, don't leave me!</sub></sub>

Disclaimer: This is not a complete, detailed or sophisticated guide that encompasses the entirety of reverse engineering. This should be treated as a guide consisting of pointers to help readers onto the right track. This comes from my **own** experiences and methodology. I do not claim it to be the only and absolute approach. This was written to give another perspective on how reverse engineering may be done and to provide yet another resource for the aspiring students.

## Schedule

There's currently no planned schedule on when tutorials will be released but _ideally_ at least once a week. But nothing ever goes to plan, does it. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

Stay tuned! :)
